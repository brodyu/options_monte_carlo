# Beyond Delta: Using Monte Carlo to Analyze Options Trades

### Background
A deep dive into implementing Monte Carlo simulations for options selling strategies, focusing on credit spreads. We explore how to model stock price movements using Geometric Brownian Motion, simulate thousands of potential paths, and calculate probabilities of profit. This practical guide includes Python code for traders who want to enhance their risk management and probability analysis for index and single-stock options like SPX, CRM, and Netflix.
